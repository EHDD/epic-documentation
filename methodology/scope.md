# Scope

### Time Horizon

EPIC uses a 30-year time horizon.

### Life Cycle Stages

EPIC integrates data from life cycle modules A1-A3 and B2-B6. These correspond to the impacts of the materials used in the project, their replacement over time, and the projectâ€™s operational energy use. When biogenic carbon is counted, some end-of-life impacts (from modules C3-C4) are assessed during the product phase (see appendix [Biogenic Carbon](../backmatter/biogenic-carbon.md)).

### Embodied Carbon Scope

EPIC considers embodied carbon from a number of sources. Its scope may be distinct from other tools.

* Building structure
* Cladding, glazing, and roofing
  * Replacement of cladding and glazing
* Interior fit-out
  * Replacement of interior fit-out
* MEP systems
* PV arrays
* Annual landscape maintenance

### Operational Carbon Scope

EPIC considers the emissions associated with a project based on averages by state. Onsite fossil fuel use is assumed to be natural gas, and its proportion of total energy use is based on averages from the CBECS and RECS databases.

### Stored Carbon Scope

EPIC includes stored carbon from timber structural systems and site landscaping. Planting and structural storage are calculated over the 30-year time horizon then annualized. EPIC's method for calculating carbon storage is detailed in the appendix on [biogenic carbon](../backmatter/biogenic-carbon.md).
