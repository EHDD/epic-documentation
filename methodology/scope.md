# Goal and Scope

## Goal

EPIC is a design tool that integrates assessments of embodied, operational, and landscape carbon in a data model to support low-carbon design when data is scarce.

EPIC is designed for use during site and feasibility studies, requests for proposals, pre-design, and in other situations where quantitative support is needed for low-carbon design decisions and completing a whole-building life cycle assessment and/or energy model is not practicable.&#x20;

EPIC provides directionally accurate guidance for specific projects by helping to identify which carbon reduction strategies a project should pursue, and helps to guide decarbonization of portfolios and portions of the building stock where EPIC's model assumptions have been tested (i.e., in the continental United States).&#x20;

EPIC is a work in progress; future development will respond to user feedback, incorporate improved data, and refine the tool's methodology. We're always seeking [feedback](mailto:epic@ehdd.com?subject=Feedback).

## Scope

### Time Horizon

EPIC can accommodate time horizons of 30 or 60 years. Currently, the web application can only accommodate a 30 year time horizon. For analysis on a 60 year time horizon, [use our API](../epic-data-model/api.md).&#x20;

### Life Cycle Stages

EPIC integrates data from life cycle stages (sometimes called "life cycle modules") A1-A5, B2-B6, and C2-C4. These correspond to the impacts of the materials used in the project, emissions from  construction, their replacement over time, and the projectâ€™s operational energy use. When biogenic carbon is counted, some end-of-life impacts (from modules C3-C4) are assessed during the product phase (see appendix [Biogenic Carbon](broken-reference)).

### Embodied Carbon Scope

EPIC includes an assessment of embodied carbon from the following sources:

* Building structure and foundation
* Construction activities
* Cladding, glazing, and roofing and their replacement over time
* Interior fit-out and its replacement over time
* MEP systems and their replacement over time
* PV arrays and their replacement over time
* Regular landscape maintenance, assessed annually

### Operational Carbon Scope

EPIC considers operational emissions from the following sources:

* Emissions from the combustion of methane gas in the building
* Upstream leakage of methane gas as a proportion of methane gas combusted in the building
* Upstream emissions from the generation of electricity delivered to the site

### Stored Carbon Scope

EPIC includes an estimate of carbon storage in timber structural systems and site landscaping. Carbon storage in planting is calculated over the time horizon then annualized. Carbon storage in building structure is assigned to the first year of the project. EPIC's method for calculating carbon storage in timber structural systems is detailed in the section on [stored and avoided carbon](carbon-reduction-measures/calculations-2.md).

### Refining EPIC's Scope

In EPIC, you can add or remove some life cycle modules and building components from the scope of a project. When comparing results between EPIC models, between EPIC and wbLCA, or between any estimates of carbon emissions, _the scopes of each result must be identical._&#x20;

When EPIC's scope is defined for a given project, that same definition of scope will be used in each of the project's scenarios. More information on how to define the scope of analysis within EPIC is available in the user's guide [here](../users-guide/base-case/refine-project-scope.md).

### Uncertainty

Anecdotal evidence has put EPIC results (modeled without any customization) within 5-30% of the estimates generated by whole building Life Cycle Assessment and hourly operational carbon assessment.&#x20;

Customizing EPIC's parameters removes them from the calculation of uncertainty. To the extent that customizations are present, we assumes that they represent commitments made by the project team. _<mark style="color:green;">A description of uncertainty is coming soon to the public web application.</mark>_
