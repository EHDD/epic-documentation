# Scope

### Time Horizon

EPIC can accommodate time horizons of 30 or 60 years. Currently, the web application can only accommodate a 30 year time horizon. For analysis on a 60 year time horizon, [use our API](../access-epic-via-api.md).&#x20;

### Life Cycle Stages

EPIC integrates data from life cycle modules A1-A5, B2-B6, and C2-C4. These correspond to the impacts of the materials used in the project, emissions from  construction, their replacement over time, and the projectâ€™s operational energy use. When biogenic carbon is counted, some end-of-life impacts (from modules C3-C4) are assessed during the product phase (see appendix [Biogenic Carbon](../backmatter/biogenic-carbon.md)).



### Embodied Carbon Scope

EPIC includes an assessment of embodied carbon from the following sources:

* Building structure and foundation
* Construction activities
* Cladding, glazing, and roofing and their replacement over time
* Interior fit-out and its replacement over time
* MEP systems and their replacement over time
* PV arrays and their replacement over time
* Regular landscape maintenance, assessed annually

### Operational Carbon Scope

EPIC considers operational emissions from the following sources:

* Emissions from the combustion of methane gas in the building
* Upstream leakage of methane gas as a proportion of methane gas combusted in the building
* Upstream emissions from the generation of electricity delivered to the site

### Stored Carbon Scope

EPIC includes an estimate of carbon storage in timber structural systems and site landscaping. Carbon storage in planting is calculated over the time horizon then annualized. Carbon storage in building structure is assigned to the first year of the project. EPIC's method for calculating carbon storage in timber structural systems is detailed in the appendix on [biogenic carbon](../backmatter/biogenic-carbon.md).
