# Benchmarking EPIC

During EPIC's development, we have used the Carbon Leadership Forum's 2017 _Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study_ (available [here](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/lca-benchmark-database/)) as a reference point for the embodied carbon emission intensities across building types. While the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) study acknowledges that the study uses data from "non-aligned studies that used different building scopes, different LCA data, and different LCA methods" and "is not a statistically representative sample of current building practices," it remains one of the most comprehensive references for embodied carbon emissions from buildings.

To compare EPIC to the CLF study, we assessed 160 cases in the EPIC model. We assumed each building had four equal-area stories and modeled across five total floor areas (20,000 sf, 40,000 sf, 60,000 sf, 80,000 sf, and 100,000 sf) across four use types (assembly, education, multi-family residence, and office).  For each building of each size and use type, we evaluated the carbon footprint for four structural systems (mass timber, reinforced concrete, steel frame, and light wood frame).&#x20;

The emissions from these buildings were assessed both as a Base Case building in EPIC and as a "Low Carbon" case. The Low Carbon case includes carbon reduction measures for "low carbon" specification (for concrete, steel, envelope, and interior), a 50-year envelope refurbishment period, and 20-year interior refurbishment period.

The results from these 160 cases were grouped by use type (n=40 for each use type) and plotted as a box and whisker plot alongside a similar plot generated from the CLF study. For comparison, these plots are reproduced below. The "X" marks the mean of the distribution.&#x20;
