# Methodology

## Goal

EPIC is a design tool that integrates assessments of embodied, operational, and sequestered carbon in a data model to support low-carbon design at the earliest stages of a project.

EPIC is designed for use during site and feasibility studies, requests for proposals, pre-design, and in other early-phase activities where quantitative support is needed for low-carbon design decisions and a whole-building life cycle assessment is not practicable. EPIC is not comprehensive: the tool uses a data model to assess the carbon emissions associated with, and the effects of carbon reduction measures on, some components of a project for some stages of a projectâ€™s life cycle.  EPIC's scope is designed to maximize a designer's ability to assess low-carbon design strategies in early project phases within the limitations of currently available data. EPIC is a work in progress; future development will respond to user feedback, incorporate improved data, and refine the tool's methodology.
