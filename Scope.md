# Scope

**Time Horizon**
Epic uses a 30-year time horizon.

**Life Cycle Stages**
EPIC integrates data from life cycle modules A1-A3 and B2-B6. These correspond to the impacts of the materials used in the project, their replacement over time, and the projectâ€™s operational energy use. When biogenic carbon is counted, some end-of-life impacts (from modules C3-C4) are assessed during the product phase
