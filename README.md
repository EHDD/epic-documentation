The Early Phase Integrated Carbon (EPIC) assessment is a whole life carbon tool built by EHDD to support climate-positive design decisions in early project phases when data is scarce but the potential for emissions reduction is high. To overcome the scarcity of data, EPIC uses a model that combines regionally-specific background data, forward-looking projections, peer-reviewed findings, and common sense assumptions to assess the relative impact of a variety of carbon reduction measures on a project’s embodied, operational, and landscape carbon footprints.&#x20;

**EPIC is useful to project teams:**

* in setting a whole life carbon budget for a project.
* to evaluate the most impactful strategies for reducing whole life carbon emissions at the very beginning of a project, when data is scarce but the potential for reducing emissions is high
* to roughly approximate whole life carbon emissions from a project when completing an energy model and a wbLCA is not practical.

EPIC is designed to allow a user to enter a strict minimum of project parameters and to test a wide range of the most meaningful carbon reduction strategies. These parameters are insufficient, of course, to describe the complexity of any real project. In rough terms, EPIC is designed as a conceptual parallel to ‘shoebox’ energy or daylight models—the results do not correspond directly to a specific building but can help us to understand which strategies could perform well, are unlikely to succeed, or are worthy of more attention.
