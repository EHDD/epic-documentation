# ðŸš€ Get Started with EPIC

### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. [Create a Project](1.-create-a-project/)&#x20;
2. [Set a Baseline](base-case/)
3. [Reduce Emissions](carbon-reduction-measures/)
4. [Compare Scenarios](scenario-comparison.md)

### Important definitions

* A **Project** includes a baseline and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Baseline** is a scenario for a project where no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. To define a baseline, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions based on user inputs. When EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be refined.
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower a project's carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed individually and compared against one another in the [Compare Scenarios](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/compare-scenarios) tab.

### The C.Scale data model

EPIC is powered by the [C.Scale](https://www.cscale.io) data model.
