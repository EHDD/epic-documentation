# üìç Get Started with EPIC

### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. Define a project and set a baseline in the [**Base Case** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/base-case)
2. Create decarbonization scenarios in the [**Reduce Emissions** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/carbon-reduction-measures)
3. Compare between decarbonization scenarios in the [**Compare Scenarios** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/compare-scenarios)

### Important definitions

* A **Project** includes a base case and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Base Case** is a scenario for a project where no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. To define a base case, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions based on user inputs. When EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be overridden in the [overrides](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/users-guide/base-case/overrides) menu in the base case tab.
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower a project's carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed individually in the [Reduce Emissions](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/carbon-reduction-measures) tab and compared against one another in the [Compare Scenarios](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/compare-scenarios) tab.

### The c.scale data model

EPIC is powered by the [**c.scale** data model](https://www.epic-docs.dev/c.scale-data-model/methodology).
