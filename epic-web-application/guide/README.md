# Welcome to EPIC!

### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. Define a project and set a baseline the [**Base Case** tab](base-case/)
2. Create decarbonization scenarios in the [**Reduce Emissions** tab](carbon-reduction-measures/)
3. Compare between decarbonization scenarios in the [**Compare Scenarios** tab](scenario-comparison.md)

#### Important definitions:

* A **Project** includes a base case and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Base Case** is a description of the project where no attempts have been made to decarbonize. To calculate the base case emissions, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions. When EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be overridden in the **Overrides** menu in the base case tab.&#x20;
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower the carbon emissions from a given project. Scenarios are constructed individually in the decarbonization measures tab, and compared against one another in the scenario comparison tab.

### EPIC's Methodology

EPIC's methodology for calculating carbon emissions is documented [here](../../epic-data-model/methodology/). &#x20;
