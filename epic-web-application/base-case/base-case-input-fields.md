# Base Case Input Fields

### Building Structure

**Primary structural system**

The base case structural system selected from the choices below:

<details>

<summary>Structural Systems included in EPIC</summary>

* _Composite_ s_teel frame_. A structural system comprised of steel columns, beams, and girders connected with rigid or pin joints. Floors are steel decking with a concrete topping slab.&#x20;

<!---->

* _Reinforced concrete_. A structural system comprised of columns, beams, and slabs of concrete reinforced with steel that provides tensile strength.

<!---->

* _Hybrid concrete/steel (high-rise)_. A structural system that combines rigid steel frames with concrete columns, beams, and slabs. These hybrid structures are more materially intensive and may be used when there are significant seismic loads, in high-rise buildings, or for programs with very high live or environmental loads.

<!---->

* _Wood frame_. A structural system comprised of dimensional lumber, plywood sheathing, and reinforced concrete cores and podiums.

<!---->

* _Comprehensive mass timber_. A structural system comprised of massive beams, panels, and columns, often assembled by aggregating many smaller timber elements. This approach assumes that timber elements are aggressively substituted for other structural materials.

**Planted Area**

The planted area located outside the building's footprint. This input cannot be less than the site area less the average aboveground floor area. All unplanted area is assumed to be hardscape.&#x20;
