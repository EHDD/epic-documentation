# 2️⃣ Set a Baseline

EPIC assesses the efficacy of carbon reduction measures in relative terms as a reduction in the carbon emissions from a baseline scenario. The baseline scenario is determined from a set of conservative assumptions which represent a project in which no efforts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. The baseline scenario provides a means of comparison for evaluating carbon reduction measures.&#x20;

* Baseline scenarios are **fully customizable.**&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios can be configured as **new construction, renovation or a combination of both**.&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios can be configured **to align with code**.&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios are flexible, and **any scenario can be tagged as the baseline**.

### Refining the Baseline

In the left-hand panel, **select the scenario tagged "Baseline"**.

</div>

After selecting the baseline scenario in the left-hand panel, the following warning will be displayed in the right-hand panel. The warning serves as a reminder that you are editing the baseline, which is used as the reference for all other scenarios.

</div>

The baseline can be refined using the [**Carbon Reduction Measures**](../carbon-reduction-measures/reduction-and-reuse.md) in the right-hand panel.&#x20;

### Setting Another Scenario as the Baseline

Any scenario within the project can be set as the baseline, and serve as the reference point for the project. To set another scenario as the baseline, click the **3-dot menu** to the right of the scenario name in the left-hand panel.&#x20;

</div>

Within the menu, click **Set as Baseline** to set another scenario as the reference for comparison.

### Analyzing the Baseline

The baseline scenario can be analyzed using the following charts:

* [Over Time](../carbon-reduction-measures/analyze-scenarios.md#over-time-chart)
* [Scope Categories](../carbon-reduction-measures/analyze-scenarios.md#scope-categories-chart)
* [LCA Stages](../carbon-reduction-measures/analyze-scenarios.md#lca-stages-chart)
* [Summary](../carbon-reduction-measures/analyze-scenarios.md#summary-chart)

### Comparing Against the Baseline

The baseline scenario can be compared with other scenarios using the following charts:

* Over Time
* Summary
