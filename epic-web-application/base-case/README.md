# 2️⃣ Set a Baseline

EPIC assesses the efficacy of carbon reduction measures in relative terms as a reduction in the carbon emissions from a baseline scenario. The baseline scenario is determined from a set of conservative assumptions which represent a project in which no efforts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. The baseline scenario provides a means of comparison for evaluating carbon reduction measures.&#x20;

* Baseline scenarios are **fully customizable.**&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios can be configured as **new construction, renovation or a combination of both**.&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios can be configured **to align with code**.&#x20;
* Baseline scenarios are flexible, and **any scenario can be tagged as the baseline**.

### Refining the Baseline

In the left-hand panel, select the scenario tagged "Baseline".

After selecting the baseline scenario in the left-hand panel, the following warning will be displayed in the right-hand panel as a reminder that you are editing the baseline, which serves as the reference for all other scenarios.

Using the right hand panel, the baseline can be refined using the [Carbon Reduction Input Fields](../carbon-reduction-measures/reduction-and-reuse.md).&#x20;

### Analyzing the Baseline

The baseline scenario can be analyzed using the following charts:

* This Scenario - Over Time
* This Scenario - Scope Categories
* This Scenario - LCA Stages
* This Scenario - Summary

### Comparing Against the Baseline

The baseline scenario can be compared with other scenarios using the following charts:

* Compare Scenarios - Over Time
* Compare Scenarios - Summary

### Base Case Chart

The base case is summarized with a donut chart showing the proportion of embodied, operational, and stored carbon emissions over the reference period.

**Total Emissions**. The sum of carbon emissions (in metric tons CO2e) from the project across the reference period.&#x20;

**Embodied Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) within the [project scope](broken-reference) from material inputs, construction process, material replacement, maintenance, and (where applicable) end-of-life.

**Operational Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) across the reference period from onsite combustion, electricity use, and fossil fuel leakage in mixed-fuel buildings.

**Carbon Storage**. Carbon stored in mature and maintained landscaping on the project site.

**Energy Use Intensity (EUI)**. Base case energy use by the building per square foot per year. If the you have not entered a benchmark EUI, the EUI is estimated via [ZeroTool](https://zerotool.org/).&#x20;

**Embodied Carbon Intensity (ECI)**. Base case embodied carbon emissions from the building over its reference period and within the [project scope](broken-reference).
