# Overrides

Overrides affect the assumptions in the base case and all scenarios within a project.

#### **Base case EUI override**

If the EUI required for a project will be significantly different from Zero Tool's EUI estimate, your preferred EUI can be entered here.&#x20;

#### **% onsite fossil fuel combustion**

The percentage of building energy use resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel at the building site. Default values via Zero Tool.&#x20;



#### Solar ground coverage ratio

For any solar array entered as a decarbonization measure, this ratio describes the ratio of active solar cells to total array area. EPIC's assumption is 0.7, representing an efficient solar layout.&#x20;
