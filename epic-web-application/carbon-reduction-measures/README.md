# 3️⃣ Reduce Emissions

To determine a decarbonization target for the project, carbon reduction measures can be applied to scenarios. EPIC highlights salient carbon reduction measures that can be consistently modeled with available data. The set of carbon reduction measures included in EPIC do not represent an exhaustive list of possible emission reduction strategies.

Carbon reduction measures in EPIC are generally divided into the following categories:

* [**Reuse**](reduction-and-reuse.md#reduction-and-reuse). These measures deal with the savings from reuse of existing building assemblies.
* **Form and Massing**. These measures pertain to the impact the form of the building has on the amount of materials used in the structure and enclosure.&#x20;
* **Energy Use**. These measures pertain to reducing the use of energy in the building, and selecting clean sources of energy.
* **Structure**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the substructure and superstructure, including both lateral and gravity systems.
* **Enclosure**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the opaque enclosure, transparent enclosure, and roofing, and their replacement periods.
* **Interior**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the interior construction and fit-out, and their replacement periods.
* **Services**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services and PV Array, and their replacement periods.
* **Refrigerants**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the refrigerants used in building services (e.g., HVAC+R).
* [**Sitework**](reduction-and-reuse.md#site-and-landscape). These measures pertain to the hardscape and landscape surrounding the building, and assess their respective potential to add or sequester carbon.
* **Jobsite**. These measures pertain to the construction-related (A5) emissions.
