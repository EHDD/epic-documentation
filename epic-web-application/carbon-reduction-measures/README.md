# 3️⃣ Reduce Emissions

To determine a decarbonization target for the project, carbon reduction measures can be applied to scenarios. EPIC highlights salient carbon reduction measures that can be consistently modeled with available data. The set of carbon reduction measures included in EPIC do not represent an exhaustive list of possible emission reduction strategies.

Carbon reduction measures in EPIC are generally divided into the following categories:

* [**Reuse**](reduction-and-reuse.md#reduction-and-reuse). These measures deal with the savings from reuse of existing building assemblies.
* **Form and Massing**. These measures pertain to the impact the form of the building has on the amount of materials used in the structure and enclosure.&#x20;
* **Energy Use**. These measures pertain to reducing the use of energy in the building, and selecting clean sources of energy.
* **Structure**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the substructure and superstructure, including both lateral and gravity systems.
* **Enclosure**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the opaque enclosure, transparent enclosure, and roofing, and their replacement periods.
* **Interior**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the interior construction and fit-out, and their replacement periods.
* **Services**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services and PV Array, and their replacement periods.
* **Refrigerants**. These measures pertain to selecting low carbon alternatives for the refrigerants used in building services (e.g., HVAC+R).
* [**Sitework**](reduction-and-reuse.md#site-and-landscape). These measures pertain to the hardscape and landscape surrounding the building, and assess their respective potential to add or sequester carbon.
* **Jobsite**. These measures pertain to the construction-related (A5) emissions.

## Analyzing Scenarios

### Over Time

This figure describes the cumulative carbon emissions of a building over time. As a chart of cumulative emissions, the height of the bar in each year is the total emissions associated with the building up to and including that year rather than only the emissions associated with that year.

The cumulative emissions over time chart has a number of elements:

* **Reduction from Baseline**. Cumulative reduction in emissions of the current scenario as compared to the base case.
* **Refrigerant Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the refrigerant use in the building services.&#x20;
* **Electricity Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the energy use from the electrical grid.&#x20;
* **Fossil Fuel Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with onsite fossil fuel use.&#x20;
* **Embodied carbon emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with building materials, their replacements, and with landscape maintenance.
* **Biogenic Carbon Storage**. Sequestered emissions from building structure and landscape planting.
* **Avoided Energy Emissions**. Avoided emissions from onsite energy generation in excess of use.
* **Net Emissions**. Operational, embodied, and refrigerant emissions minus biogenic carbon storage and and avoided energy emissions.
* **Climate Positive Threshold**. When the net emissions of a project crosses the zero line, the crossing point is marked as the Climate Positive threshold.

Hovering over a bar gives the summary of emissions in that year. This is useful for determining how the project is performing against time-based targets (e.g. a 2030 net zero target). Hovering over the final year in the chart gives the total emissions across the analysis period. Note that these numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and may not sum to net emissions in all cases.

### Embodied Carbon Budget

This chart breaks down the contributions to embodied carbon emissions by category. This figure represents the total cumulative emissions associated with the project scenario after 30 years.

When comparing EPIC results to wbLCA results at later project phases, this breakdown can be helpful in confirming if designs are within the carbon budget for a particular scope or for the project as a whole.&#x20;

### Base Case Chart

The base case is summarized with a donut chart showing the proportion of embodied, operational, and stored carbon emissions over the reference period.

**Total Emissions**. The sum of carbon emissions (in metric tons CO2e) from the project across the reference period.&#x20;

**Embodied Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) within the [project scope](broken-reference) from material inputs, construction process, material replacement, maintenance, and (where applicable) end-of-life.

**Operational Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) across the reference period from onsite combustion, electricity use, and fossil fuel leakage in mixed-fuel buildings.

**Carbon Storage**. Carbon stored in mature and maintained landscaping on the project site.

**Energy Use Intensity (EUI)**. Base case energy use by the building per square foot per year. If the you have not entered a benchmark EUI, the EUI is estimated via [ZeroTool](https://zerotool.org/).&#x20;

**Embodied Carbon Intensity (ECI)**. Base case embodied carbon emissions from the building over its reference period and within the [project scope](broken-reference).
