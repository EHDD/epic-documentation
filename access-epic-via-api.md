# Access EPIC via API

In addition to the open access version of EPIC available, the data model behind EPIC is accessible via API. By allowing direct access to the data behind EPIC, using our API has given organizations the ability to perform large-scale analysis such as:

* Analyze "look-ahead" scenarios for the construction or acquisition of large portfolios of buildings.
* Perform sensitivity testing of carbon reduction measures.
* Stress-test planning and policy decisions at the municipal, regional, or national scale.

API integration has also allowed organizations to extend EPIC to meet their specific needs:

* Supplement the EPIC model with building-specific data or organization-specific carbon reduction measures.
* Integrate EPIC into their existing ESG and carbon accounting platforms.
* Deploy a custom versions of EPIC to an organization's internal servers.

API access is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and tailored to meet your organization's specific needs. If you are interested in learning more, [please contact our team](mailto:epic@ehdd.com?API).  &#x20;
