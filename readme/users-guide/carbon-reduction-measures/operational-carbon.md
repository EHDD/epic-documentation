# Operational Carbon

### No onsite combustion (all-electric)

The elimination of all onsite combustion and provision of 100% of the project’s energy use from electric sources.

### EUI reduction

The reduction of the building’s EUI by any of a number of strategies. There are two forms this input can take:

* **EUI target.** The desired EUI in the target case.
* **Percent reduction.** The percentage reduction of EUI of the target case against the base case.

### Solar photovoltaic (PV) array

The construction of a solar PV array on the project site. The size of this array can be input in three forms:

* **Area.** The solar PV area size is input by its total area in square feet.
* **Capacity.** The solar PV area size is input by its nameplate capacity in kW.
* **% of load.** The solar PV area size is calculated to account for the input percentage of building energy load.

#### Solar PV orientation

The ability of solar PV arrays to produce electricity is related to their geometry and siting. Not all projects sites, such as partially shaded sites, will have an optimal solar orientation. This toggle has two options:

* **Optimal.** There is no impediment on the site to maximum solar exposure.
* **Suboptimal.** There is solar potential on the site, but it is partly compromised. A 20% penalty on solar energy production will be assessed.

### Clean power purchase

The purchase of clean power through the relevant electric utility, or the purchase of third-party certified renewable energy credits (RECs) equivalent to the selected percentage of total energy use. Some operational emissions (20%) will persist after the clean power purchase to account for the real emissions that are still generated on an electrical grid with both renewable and carbon-emitting energy sources. There are three options for this measure:

* **None.** No purchase of clean power or RECs.
* **Low.** Purchase of clean power to cover 50% of building energy use.
* **High.** Purchase of clean power to cover 100% of building energy use.
* <mark style="color:green;">**24/7 clean electrification**</mark><mark style="color:green;">. Time matched purchase of zero-carbon power to ensure that building emissions are totally offset.</mark> _<mark style="color:green;">(coming soon)</mark>_
