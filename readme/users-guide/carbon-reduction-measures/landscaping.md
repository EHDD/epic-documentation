# Site Landscaping

This set of measures describes potential carbon storage in the landscape as well as annual emissions associated with the landscape's upkeep.

### Additional Planting Area

Adds additional planting area to the area defined in the base case.

### Carbon Storing Landscape

Definition of the proportion of total planted area that is low, moderate, or high carbon storage.

* **Low carbon storage planted area.** Example of a low carbon storage landscape is no-mow turfgrass or other herbaceous perennials. This is the assumption for all planted areas in the base case.
* **Moderate carbon storage planted area.** An example of a moderate carbon storage landscape is low shrubs and small trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass or herbaceous perennials.
* **High carbon storage planted area.** An example of a high carbon storage landscape is one composed of dense broadleaf shrubs and trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass or herbaceous perennials.
