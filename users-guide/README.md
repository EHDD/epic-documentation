# üìç Get Started with EPIC

### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. Define a project and set a baseline in the <a href="https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/base-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">**Base Case** tab</a>

2. Create decarbonization scenarios in the <a href="https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/carbon-reduction-measures" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">**Reduce Emissions** tab</a>

3. Compare between decarbonization scenarios in the <a href="https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/compare-scenarios" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">**Compare Scenarios** tab</a>


#### Important definitions:

* A **Project** includes a base case and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Base Case** is a description of the project where no attempts have been made to decarbonize. To calculate the base case emissions, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions. When EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be overridden in the **Overrides** menu in the base case tab.&#x20;
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower the carbon emissions from a given project. Scenarios are constructed individually in the decarbonization measures tab, and compared against one another in the scenario comparison tab.

### EPIC's Methodology

EPIC's methodology for calculating carbon emissions is documented [here](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-data-model/methodology). &#x20;
