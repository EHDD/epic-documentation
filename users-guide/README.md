# User's Guide

### How do I use EPIC?

First, a user must enter a set of basic parameters to define a base building. All assessments with EPIC begin with the definition of a [base case](base-case/). Once a base case is set, a set of carbon reduction measures can be tested against the base case to determine a project scenario. As the set of [carbon reduction measures](carbon-reduction-measures/) is defined, EPIC automatically tracks their effects in a series of figures.&#x20;

When a project team is considering several low-carbon design strategies, sets of carbon reduction measures can be saved as [scenarios](carbon-reduction-measures/scenarios.md) and compared against each other.&#x20;

Like all models, EPIC is based on a number of assumptions. These assumptions may reduce its applicability to particular cases. EPIC allows you to [override](base-case/overrides.md) some of its built-in assumptions. Altering these assumptions may assist in modeling some projects more accurately, but may also lead to unrealistic results.&#x20;

A video tutorial that walks through the use of EPIC is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAN5Nc6zsB4).

### Interpreting EPIC's results

Tips for interpreting results and figures are located throughout this guide. If something remains unclear after reading the guide, please [send feedback](https://forms.gle/2Hy6SEdkEJj4WMVr6) to guide us as we improve the tool and its documentation.&#x20;

EPIC is a data-driven tool and some fluency in data and units is necessary to interpret the tool's results. To aid in this interpretation, a [brief note on units](../appendices/units-in-epic.md) is included as an appendix below.&#x20;
