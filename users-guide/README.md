# üìç Get Started with EPIC

### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. Define a project and set a baseline in the [**Base Case** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/base-case)
2. Create decarbonization scenarios in the [**Reduce Emissions** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/carbon-reduction-measures)
3. Compare between decarbonization scenarios in the [**Compare Scenarios** tab](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-web-application/guide/compare-scenarios)

#### Important definitions:

* A **Project** includes a base case and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A [**Base Case**](base-case/) is a description of the project where no attempts have been made to decarbonize. To calculate the base case emissions, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions. When EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be overridden in the **Overrides** menu in the base case tab.
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower a project's carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed individually in the [Reduce Emissions](carbon-reduction-measures/) tab and compared against one another in the [scenario comparison](scenario-comparison.md) tab.

### EPIC's Methodology

EPIC's methodology for calculating carbon emissions is documented [**here**](https://www.epic-docs.dev/epic-data-model/methodology).
