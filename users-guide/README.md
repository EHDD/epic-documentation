### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, the basic workflow is:

1. Define a project and its Base Case in the [**Base Case** tab](base-case/)
2. Define individual decarbonization scenarios in the [**Carbon Reduction Measures** tab](carbon-reduction-measures/)
3. Compare between scenarios in the [**Scenario Comparison** tab](scenario-comparison.md)

Important defintions

* A **project** is a bundle including a base case and one or scenarios.
* A **base case** is a description of the project wherein no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. The base case is defined by a small set of parameters, including location, use, and size. For these parameters, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions.
  * In some cases, EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions may not describe the reality on a specific project. These assumptions can be reviewed and adjusted in the **overrides** pulldown in the base case tab. Altering these assumptions may assist in modeling some projects more accurately, but may also lead to unrealistic results.
* A **scenario** describes an attempt to lower the carbon emissions from the project. Scenarios are constructed individually in the decarbonization measures tab, and compared against one another in the scenario comparsion tab.

### Interpreting EPIC's results

Tips for interpreting results and figures are located throughout this guide. If something remains unclear after reading the guide, please [send feedback](https://forms.gle/2Hy6SEdkEJj4WMVr6) to guide us as we improve the tool and its documentation.

EPIC's methodology for calculating carbon emissions is documented [here](../methodology/). &#x20;
