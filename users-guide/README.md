### How do I use EPIC?

In EPIC, you define a project base case and test out carbon reduction scenarios.

* A **project** is a bundle including a base case and one or scenarios.
* A **base case** is a description of the project wherein no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. The base case is defined by a small set of parameters, including location, use, and size. For these parameters, EPIC makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions.
  * In some cases, EPIC's "business as usual" assumptions may not describe the reality on a specific project. These assumptions can be reviewed and adjusted in the **overrides** pulldown in the base case tab. Altering these assumptions may assist in modeling some projects more accurately, but may also lead to unrealistic results.
* A **scenario** describes an attempt to lower the carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed in the carbon reduction measures tab and compaed in the scenario tab.

The basic workflow in EPIC is

1. Define a project and its Base Case in the **Base Case** tab
2. Define individual scenarios in the **Carbon Reduction Measures** tab
3. Compare those scenarios in the **Scenario** tab

### Interpreting EPIC's results

Tips for interpreting results and figures are located throughout this guide. If something remains unclear after reading the guide, please [send feedback](https://forms.gle/2Hy6SEdkEJj4WMVr6) to guide us as we improve the tool and its documentation.

EPIC is a data-driven tool and some fluency in data and units is necessary to interpret the tool's results. To aid in this interpretation, a [brief note on units](broken-reference) is included as an appendix below.
