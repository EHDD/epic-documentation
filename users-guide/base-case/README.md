# Base Case

EPIC assesses the efficacy of carbon reduction measures in relative terms as a reduction in the carbon emissions from a base case building. The base case building is a building determined from a set of conservative assumptions which represent a newly constructed project in which no efforts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. The base case provides a means of comparison for evaluating carbon reduction measures.&#x20;

When the base case form is filled, click the "Save Base Case" button at the bottom of the form to save the base case and generate the base case figure and table.

### [Base Case Input Fields](base-case-input-fields.md)

Explanations of each base case input field are listed together on the page linked above.

### Base Case Chart

The base case is summarized with a donut chart showing the proportion of embodied, operational, and stored carbon emissions over the reference period.

**Total Emissions**. The sum of carbon emissions (in metric tons CO2e) from the project across the reference period.&#x20;

**Embodied Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) within the [project scope](refine-project-scope.md) from material inputs, construction process, material replacement, maintenance, and (where applicable) end-of-life.

**Operational Emissions**. The sum of all emissions (in metric tons CO2e) across the reference period from onsite combustion, electricity use, and fossil fuel leakage in mixed-fuel buildings.

**Carbon Storage**. Carbon stored in mature and maintained landscaping on the project site.

**Energy Use Intensity (EUI)**. Base case energy use by the building per square foot per year. If the you have not entered a benchmark EUI, the EUI is estimated via [ZeroTool](https://zerotool.org/).&#x20;

**Embodied Carbon Intensity (ECI)**. Base case embodied carbon emissions from the building over its reference period and within the [project scope](refine-project-scope.md).
