# Refine Project Scope

One of the leading causes of misalignment between wbLCA results is that they cover different project scopes. For instance, one model may contain only "structure, foundation, and envelope" while another will contain "structure, foundation, envelope, interiors, MEP, and site."&#x20;

EPIC allows project teams to refine the scope of analysis, including or excluding parts of the building to meet reporting goals or to faciliate comparison with other projects.&#x20;

#### Changes to project scope are non-destructive

Any decarbonization measures in excludes parts of the project scope are still saved with the project, but will become temporarily unavailable as long as they are out of scope. When their scope is restored, the values will reappear as last entered.&#x20;

#### Scope is defined at the project level

The selected project scope is applied to the base case and all scenarios within a project. A user cannot exclude a scope in one scenario but include it in another; to be comparable, all scenarios must have the same scope.&#x20;
