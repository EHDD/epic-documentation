# Site Landscaping

This set of measures describes potential carbon sequestration in the landscape as well as annual emissions associated with the landscape's upkeep.&#x20;

### Additional Planting Area

Adds additional planting area to the area defined in the base case.&#x20;

### Carbon Sequestering Landscape

Definition of the proportion of total planted area that is low, moderate, or high sequestration.&#x20;

* **Low sequestration.** An example of a low sequestration landscape is no-mow turfgrass. This is the assumption for all planted areas in the base case.&#x20;
* **Moderate sequestration.** An example of a moderately sequestering landscape is low shrubs and small trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass.&#x20;
* **High sequestration.** An example of a high sequestration landscape is one composed of dense broadleaf shrubs and trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass.
