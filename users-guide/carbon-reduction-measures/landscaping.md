* **Low carbon storage planted area.**  Example of a low carbon storage landscape is no-mow turfgrass or other herbaceous perennials. This is the assumption for all planted areas in the base case.&#x20;
* **Moderate carbon storage planted area.** An example of a moderate carbon storage landscape is low shrubs and small trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass or herbaceous perennials.&#x20;
* **High carbon storage planted area.** An example of a high carbon storage landscape is one composed of dense broadleaf shrubs and trees in a matrix of no-mow turfgrass or herbaceous perennials.
