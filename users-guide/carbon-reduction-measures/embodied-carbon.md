# Embodied Carbon

## Embodied Carbon Measures - Structure

### New primary structural system

Specification of a structural system other than the system modeled in the base case. Note that this is not strictly a carbon _reduction_ measure, as the substitution of some structural systems with some others can lead to an increase in embodied emissions. These structural systems are described in the user's guide [here](https://epic-documentation.gitbook.io/epic/users-guide/base-case#building-structure).&#x20;

### Concrete specification

The specification of concrete with lower embodied carbon emissions. These values directly correspond with the 2021 CLF values for “achievable,” “typical,” and “baseline” concrete, and descriptions for the levels are given as follows:

* **Conservative.** Typical concrete mix, no effort made to lower carbon emissions.&#x20;
* **Best practices.** Concrete with 30-50% replacement of cement by supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) and careful sizing of concrete structural elements to reduce overspecification.
* **Low-carbon.** Concrete with >50% replacement of cement by SCM, lower carbon aggregate, and careful sizing of concrete structural elements to reduce overspecification.&#x20;

### Steel specification&#x20;

The specification of structural and reinforcing steel with lower embodied carbon emissions. These values directly correspond with the 2021 CLF values for “achievable,” “typical,” and “baseline” steel, and descriptions for the levels are given as follows:

* **Conservative.** Typical steel with a typical recycled content, from a mix of blast and electric arc furnaces.
* **Best practices.** Steel from electric arc furnaces or blast furnaces with gas recovery, with high recycled content, and structural design to minimize overspecification.
* **Low-carbon.** Steel from electric arc furnaces powered with renewable energy sources, potentially with biomass reductants, with high-recycled content, and structural design to minimize overspecification and maximize reusability.

### Responsible timber sourcing&#x20;

In accordance with ISO 21930, the carbon content of biogenic materials can only be counted as carbon-storing if the timber comes from a forest managed with sustainable practices. An example of this is timber from an FSC-certified forest. For more information, please refer to the appendix on [Biogenic Carbon](../appendices/biogenic-carbon.md).

### Envelope specification&#x20;

The specification of the building cladding and façade elements with lower embodied carbon emissions. These specification levels do not describe specific assemblies. Instead, they approximate the 80th, 50th, and 20th percentile of the distribution of all envelope options. The three options for this measure and their general description:

* **Conservative.** Standard materials and assemblies, no effort made to lower carbon emissions.&#x20;
* **Best practices.** Reduce redundancies and select low-carbon materials with high levels of recycled content.&#x20;
* **Low-carbon.** Maximize biogenic materials, innovate efficient assemblies, and reduce material use.

### Envelope refurbishment period

The length of time over which a majority of the exterior envelope will be replaced.

### Interior fit-out specification

The specification of the fittings, furniture, and fixtures required for tenants by tenants who inhabit and use the building. These specification levels do not describe specific fit-outs or materials. Instead, they approximate the 80th, 50th, and 20th percentile of the distribution of all available data on tenant fit-outs.  The three options for this measure and their general description:

* **Conservative.** Standard fittings, furniture, and fixtures, no effort made to lower carbon emissions.&#x20;
* **Best practices.** Address "hot spots" (flooring, acoustic panels, casework, etc.).&#x20;
* **Low-carbon.** Comprehensive low-carbon design and specification of tenant fit-out.

### Interior fit-out refurbishment period

The length of time over which a majority of the interior fit-out will be replaced.
